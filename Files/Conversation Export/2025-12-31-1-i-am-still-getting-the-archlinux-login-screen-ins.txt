  Welcome to Opus 4.5

> i am still getting the archlinux: login screen instead of a automatic 
login, do you maybe have some credentials that i can enter is something 
wrong 

● Let me look at your project to understand the setup and find any credentials that might be configured.

● Search(pattern: "**/*config*")
  ⎿  Found 4 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "**/*.json")
  ⎿  Found 7 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "password|login|credential|user|root", glob:
        "*.{txt,md,json,yaml,yml,sh}")
  ⎿  Found 23 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(iso-profile\profiledef.sh)
  ⎿  Read 48 lines

● Read(Commands.txt)
  ⎿  Read 57 lines

● Search(pattern: "autologin|getty|agetty")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

● Found the credentials in your Commands.txt:

  Login credentials:
  - Username: archlinux
  - Password: password

  Let me also check the airootfs configuration to see if autologin is properly set up:

● Search(pattern: "iso-profile/airootfs/**/*")
  ⎿  Found 22 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(iso-profile\airootfs\etc\gdm\custom.conf)
  ⎿  Read 13 lines

● Read(iso-profile\airootfs\etc\passwd)
  ⎿  Read 3 lines

● I see the issue. Your GDM config is set up for autologin with liveuser, but you're seeing an Arch Linux login prompt. This suggests GDM might not be starting properly.

  Try these credentials for now:
  - Username: liveuser (no password) or root (no password)

  If those don't work, the archlinux/password combo from your Commands.txt was likely for a different VM setup.

  Let me check the shadow file to confirm password settings:

● Read(iso-profile\airootfs\etc\shadow)
  ⎿  Read 3 lines

● The shadow file confirms both root and liveuser have empty passwords (the :: means no password hash).

  Try:
  - Username: liveuser → Password: (leave empty, just press Enter)
  - Username: root → Password: (leave empty, just press Enter)

  Why you're not getting autologin:

  You're seeing a text-based login prompt (archlinux: login) instead of the GDM graphical login, which means:

  1. GDM isn't starting - The graphical display manager isn't running
  2. This could be because:
    - GDM service isn't enabled
    - GNOME/GDM packages aren't installed
    - Graphics drivers issue in the VM

  After logging in with liveuser (empty password), you can try starting GDM manually:
  sudo systemctl start gdm

  Would you like me to check if GDM is set to start automatically in your ISO configuration?
